# Challenges 81-90: "More maths?"

81.	Update your hexapawn game so that a player can play against the computer.

82.	Chess. Write a game of chess.

83.	Text based adventure game. Write a 1980s style text based adventure game. Have a world with at least 3 worlds, 5 objects and 2 other characters that you can speak to. This is a challenge in how to represent the world and the possible commands!

84.	Analogue clock: Write a program to draw an analogu clock on the screen. The clock should have three hands (hour, minute, second) and a date window. The clock should change as time goes by.
 
85.	Particle simulator. Write a program using a framework such as PyGame to simulate some particles in an enclosed space. They should all start in random places and have random velocities.

86.	Particle simulator 2. Extend the particle simulator program so that each particle has a random size and that particles collide with each other. When they collide they should bounce off each other.

87.	Particle simulator 3. Extend the particle simulator again. Particles should randomly be assigned as matter or antimatter. If two particles collide they will be replaced by a single particle of their combined sizes and net velocities. If an antimatter and matter particle of the same size collide, they anhialate each other completely.

88.	Write a basic calculator. It should look like a proper calculator on the screen. It only needs +, -, ÷ and x as operators but needs to work properly. The result of the previous calculation can be used for the next. Pressing the C button will reset the calculator status.

89.	Add an M+, M- and MR button to your calculator.

90.	Add more complex operations such as (), sin, tan, cos etc…
