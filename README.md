# Python-Challenges

## What is it?
- The idea of these challenges comes from my programming teacher! These are short (or start short) challenges that get you thinking logically and like a programmer.

## How does it work?
- They start *very* basic, with simple challenges like `display "hello world"` and gradually build themselves up. This allows people to experience some cool brain teasers and apply some logic!

## Can i contribute?
- Sure! see the `How to contribute.md` file.
