# Challenges 21-30: "Did someone say calculate?"


21.	Progressive taxation: Income tax is charged at a different rate depending on how much you earn. 
If you earn less than £10k you pay no income tax. If you earn less than £50k you pay 20% income tax on 
the money you earn that is more than £10k. If you earn more than £50k you pay 40% income tax on the income over £50k. 
So, if you earn £15k you will pay £1k in tax. If you earn £60k you would pay £12k in tax. Write a program that asks the 
user how much they earn and then calculates their annual income tax bill.
 
 
22.	National Insurance: National insurance is another tax paid on your income. If you earn less than £700 per 
month you do not pay it. Anything you earn between £700 and £4k per month attracts a 12% national insurance charge.
Anything you earn over £4k per month attracts a 2% charge. Modify your progressive tax program to also include a 
calculation for the amount of National Insurance that an employee would pay.


23.	Pension contribution: From your salary you also pay into a pension fund arranged by your employer. 
In most cases this is around 7.5% of your salary. Your employer will usually top this up - typically by at least 2.5%.
Calculate the total pension contribution from both the employee and the employer.


24.	Payslip: Using the information you have previously calculated produce some output to explain how we get from 
gross pay (the amount you get paid) to net pay (the amount that gets paid to you). Include on your explination 
the total amount paid into your pension. The user should enter how much they get paid per month. 
You should use subroutines to break your code into functional units.


25.	Ask the user to enter a date. Do not accept something that is not a valid date in the form `DD/MM/YYYY`. 
Check for leap years!


26.	Write a subroutine to convert from binary to hex. **YOU MAY NOT USE THE BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS**.


27.	Write a subroutine to convert from hex to binary. **YOU MAY NOT USE THE BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS**.


28.	Write a subroutine to convert from binary to denary. **YOU MAY NOT USE THE BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS**.
 
 
29.	Write a subroutine to convert from denary to binary. **YOU MAY NOT USE THE BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS**.


30.	Write a subroutine to convert from denary to hex. **YOU MAY NOT USE THE BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS**.
