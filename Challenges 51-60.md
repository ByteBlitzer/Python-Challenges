# Challenges 51 - 60: "Shopping time baby!"

51.	Ask the user for their name and their score in a test. Also ask them what subject this score was for and store this in a 2D dictionary. When all the scores have been entered, ask for a name and show all the scores for that person across all subjects. You could also ask for a subject and show all the scores by individuals for that subject.


52. Write a program that asks the user for items to add to a shopping list. When the shopping list is complete, create a file and write the items to the file.


53.	Write a program to read the items from a shopping list file and display them to the user.


54.	Write a program that asks the user what items they have bought and remove these from a shoppin list file.

56.	Ask the user for a pair of co-ordinates. Determine how far apart they are. Now extend the program to ask the user for a set of coordinates (you work out how to stop the inputs). Find the pair of coordinates that are closest to each other and the pair that are furthest from each other. Display these pairs with the distance between them.
 
 
57.	Ask the user for a nnumber between 5 and 20. Generate this number of random numbers between 2 and 50. Shuffle the numbers into two groups with the same total.
